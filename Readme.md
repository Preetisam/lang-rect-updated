Here are the detailed improvements made to the code in terms of designing, scalability, clarity, and simplicity:

1. Improved Designing:
   - Separation of Concerns: The language item is now a separate component (`LanguageItem`), which improves modularity and reusability. This separation allows for better organization of code and enhances the overall design structure.
   - CSS Styling: The CSS styles have been updated to provide a cleaner and more visually appealing design. The styles are now more consistent and easier to understand.

2. Enhanced Scalability:
   - Component-Based Approach: By introducing a separate component for each language item, the code becomes more scalable. It allows for easy addition or removal of language items without affecting other parts of the codebase.
   - Dynamic State Update: The state update functions (`handleIncrement` and `handleDecrement`) use the functional form of `setLanguages`, allowing for more scalable state management. It ensures that the state is updated based on the previous state, preventing any race conditions or inconsistencies.

3. Improved Clarity:
   - Clear Component Structure: The separation of the language item into its own component (`LanguageItem`) improves the clarity of the code. Each component now has a well-defined responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain.
   - Meaningful Function and Variable Names: The function and variable names have been chosen to be descriptive and meaningful. This makes it easier to comprehend the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.

4. Enhanced Simplicity:
   - Reduced Code Duplication: The separation of the language item into a reusable component eliminates code duplication. The `LanguageItem` component can be reused across multiple instances, resulting in simpler and more concise code.
   - Streamlined State Updates: The state updates have been simplified by using the functional form of `setLanguages`. This approach eliminates the need for manual cloning of the previous state and reduces code complexity.

Overall, these improvements enhance the code by promoting better design practices, improving scalability for future changes, enhancing clarity for easier comprehension, and simplifying the codebase by reducing duplication and complexity.
